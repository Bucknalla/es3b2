00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.440
this is an introduction to es3b2&nbsp;
es2e3 digital systems design&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.360
so the first thing we need to do to set up our&nbsp;
environment is to go ahead and download the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.480
xilinx vivado tools if you haven't already&nbsp;
you can find these at the xilinx's website

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:35.040
we go through go to download vivado we want&nbsp;
2019.2 and then you can scroll down to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.840
link that says the xilinx unified installer&nbsp;
2019 windows self-extracting web installer

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.800
you may need to create an account&nbsp;
and add any additional information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.080
before you can download hit download and then the&nbsp;
tool will open up an installation process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.240
you can take a look at that so this may take&nbsp;
some time depending on how fast your machine is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.120
while we wait for this to open  it's worth&nbsp;
heading over to a repository i've set up for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.760
the code associated with this lab you can head&nbsp;
to my github repo which should be

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.560
https://github.com/Bucknalla/es3b2 and i'll have all of the files&nbsp;
that you need for these projects and any of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.240
verilog source files and code that we end&nbsp;
up writing specifically for this module

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.920
if you want to grab this you can either&nbsp;
click download as a zip or you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.360
download it using git if you&nbsp;
are familiar with that tool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.840
so now that you've got the installer open you&nbsp;
can go through hit next add your account details

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.920
agree to the terms and conditions now what you&nbsp;
want to do is install just the vivado environment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.880
there are other products that xilinx offers&nbsp;
but this lab will focus specifically on vivado&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.800
what we want to do is we want&nbsp;
to install the vivado hl webpack

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.960
and then what we can do is if we go through&nbsp;
and have a look at the devices so what we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.600
want is we want to install only the 7 series&nbsp;
everything else we can remove to save some space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:46.560
otherwise you'll be downloading quite a lot of&nbsp;
data so just tick the option for 7 series which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.440
i think is by default selected so you'll need&nbsp;
to have 30 gigs of free space on your machine

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.760
now i already have this installed so it'll be&nbsp;
in my C:\Xilinx i recommend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.760
you install it there too it's easier to find and&nbsp;
when i'm referencing things i'll be using it from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.440
there as well at which point you can then go to&nbsp;
next and it will start the installation process
