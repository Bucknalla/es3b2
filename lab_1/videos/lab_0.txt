this is an introduction to es3b2  es32e digital systems design  
so the first thing we need to do to set up our  environment is to go ahead and download the  
xilinx vivado tools if you haven't already  you can find these at the xilinx's website
we go through go to download vivado we want  2019.2 and then you can scroll down to a  
link that says the xilinx unified installer  2019 windows self-extracting web installer
you may need to create an account  and add any additional information  
before you can download hit download and then the  tool will open up an installation process  
you can take a look at that so this may take  some time depending on how fast your machine is  
while we wait for this to open it's worth  heading over to a repository i've set up for  
the code associated with this lab you can head  to my github repo which should be
https://github.com/Bucknalla/es3b2 and i'll have all of the files  that you need for these projects and any of the  
verilog source files and code that we end  up writing specifically for this module
if you want to grab this you can either  click download as a zip or you can  
download it using git if you  are familiar with that tool  
so now that you've got the installer open you  can go through hit next add your account details
agree to the terms and conditions now what you  want to do is install just the vivado environment  
there are other products that xilinx offers  but this lab will focus specifically on vivado  
what we want to do is we want  to install the vivado hl webpack
and then what we can do is if we go through  and have a look at the devices so what we  
want is we want to install only the 7 series  everything else we can remove to save some space  
otherwise you'll be downloading quite a lot of  data so just tick the option for 7 series which  
i think is by default selected so you'll need  to have 30 gigs of free space on your machine
now i already have this installed so it'll be  in my C:\Xilinx i recommend  
you install it there too it's easier to find and  when i'm referencing things i'll be using it from  
there as well at which point you can then go to  next and it will start the installation process
